# Part II: The Digital Body & Twin World

> **"Simulation is not just a video game. It is the imagination of the robot."**

In this module, we will explore:
1.  **Digital Twin Philosophy**: Sim-to-Real gaps.
2.  **Physics of Embodiment**: Mass, inertia, friction.
3.  **World Construction**: Setting up Gazebo/Isaac Sim.
4.  **Synthetic Sensors**: How robots "see" in the matrix.
5.  **Build Milestone**: A simulation where your robot can simply *exist* and fall over realistically.
