# Module 2: Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

Create a physics-accurate simulation of your robot before deployment.

## Key Technologies
- **Gazebo**: Physics engine.
- **Unity**: Photorealistic rendering.

## Lab: Sensors
We will simulate:
1. LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging)
2. IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit)
3. Depth Cameras (Intel RealSense)

## Collision Detection
Essential for testing autonomous navigation algorithms safely.
